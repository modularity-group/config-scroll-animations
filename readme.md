Auto-scrolling to existing anchors works out-of-the-box for `href`s `#x`, `/#x`, `/en/#x`, `/de/#x`.
Selectively disabled anchor scrolling with class `no-autoscroll` on a link.

Activate the into-view-animation with the block style `Animated` which is available in groups, columns, covers, images, galleries and media-texts. Or add the class `is-style-animate-into-view` manually to any element.
